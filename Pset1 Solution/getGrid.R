  # Explanation
  
  # We need to a grid from a to b. A basic approach could involve spacing out
  # the point equally. The following line of code would achieve this:
  #     grid= linspace(a, b, GridPoints);
  
  # If we want to space them out so that the growth rate of the distance
  # between spaces is equal we achieve this by spacing out the logs of grid 
  # equally. We could achieve this by the following line of code:
  #     grid= exp(linspace(log(a), log(b), GridPoints));
  
  # This is problematic if a<=0. The approach taken here is to get a grid
  # from log(1) to log(b - a + 1), exponentiate and then subrtact 1
  # so that we have a grid from 0 to b-a. If we have add a to each point we
  # get the desired result - a log-spaced grid from a to b
  
  span <- maxongrid - minongrid;     # b - a
